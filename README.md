# How To Play
 1. Make sure you have `python 3` installed.
 2. Run `python game.py` and follow the instructions.
 3. If you want to play with Evasive and House Lannister, type `1 3` when
prompted
    1. Evasive
    2. Conquerer
    3. House Lannister
    4. House Stark
 4. After choosing the opponents, you need to choose the board you want
to play on. For example, if you want to play on a (3x3, 1) board, Enter
`3 3 1`, respectively. 

# Unit Testing
Simply run the `testTransition.py` file:

```python testTransition.py```

# Progress
* Finished implementing `Board` Class methods

    * `get_moves(position)`
    * `is_valid(source, destination)`
    * `get_sym(position)`
    * `get_direction(position)`
    * Integrated `display_state()`
    * Integrated `terminal_state()`
    * Add `self.turn` to the `Board` and check before moving 
      any piece to ensure the integrity of the game
    * Implement `move_generator(player)` method that will provide
      all the moves for a particular player

* Test coverage for finished methods
    
    - [x] `get_moves(position)`
    - [x] `is_valid(source, destination)`
    - [x] `all_moves(player)`
    - [x] `move(position, direction)`
    - [ ] `get_sym(position)`
    - [ ] `get_direction(position)`
    - [ ] `display_state()`
    - [ ] `terminal_state()`

# ToDo 
- [x] Finish implementing the `Agent` class
- [x] Decide whether to implement a function or class for `Game`
- [x] Finish `minimax` tree
- [x] Implement `conquerer` and 2 more utility functions
